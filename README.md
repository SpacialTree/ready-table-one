# ready-table-one
Repository for CodeAstro project to make publication-ready tables. 

Inspired by `astropy.table.Table`, we want to add functionality to how astropy saves tex versions of tables. We want to make these tex tables more publication-ready, with `\hline` and LaTeX markup.


Change in branch feature one.
